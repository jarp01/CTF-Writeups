<h1>Solution:</h1>
After doing reverse image search in Google, I found many different websites with the same image. So the challenge was finding where exactly the image originally belonged. I went through each of the websites having that image except Jack Ma's, thinking he would never give credit to the reporter in his tweet ;). But none of the websites had any information about the reporter I was looking for, all I found was reference to Jack Ma's tweet. So I finally visited it.  After not finding anything about reporter in his tweet I started scrolling down through the replies to see if anybody had mentioned about the reporter...and...voila! There was a reporter who wanted to know where the flight was headed, and oh yes, he also mentioned where he lived -- San Francisco! So the flag for this challenge was:
