<h1>Lo Scampo</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
Malcolm X took Broiestevane to a Day of the Dead themed party but she never returned. Her only friends, Mr Bean and the Pink Panther realised that she was missing when she didn't show up for an exam. Broiestevane liked posting pictures, where was the party held?

<h2>Solution:</h2>
<p>I had already become worried reading the name of the challenge, and reading its description and searching on search engines was like rubbing salt on wound. The reason was simple, I could find no clue to connect any of these together and every seach engine including Google could not find any result having 'Broiestevane', instead it suggested 'Brisbane', lol. After many hours of searching and thinking, then thinking and searching, I finally decided to look up the name Broiestevane in Instagram as the description said she liked posting pictures. That was that! I found her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/broiestevane">profile</a> and checked the description, where she had written:

"I cant believe I missed my exam for this party :<br />

Following this link there was the name of the place where the party was held: <h5>Liberty Hotel Boston</h5>
And the flag is:

I found that the following is also correct:

csictf{liberty_hotel}
