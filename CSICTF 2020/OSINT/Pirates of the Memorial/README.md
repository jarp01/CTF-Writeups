<h2>Solution:</h2>
<p>Uploading the given image on <code>images.google.com</code> shows the name of the place: <strong>Victoria Memorial</strong> and also multipe websites having the same or similar images. The same image had been shared in multiple platforms so it was a little difficult task to figure out the original photographer's name and his/her social media account where he/she had posted the picture and had the comment as well.</p>

<p>After going through each of the suspicious websites, I found the original photographer's name (i.e. Arunopal Banerjee) in one of the replies in a tweet. Then I combined the original photographer's name along with the name of the place that Google had earlier suggested. This refined the search results showing more relevant tweets. Then following one of the tweets, I found the original photographer had mentioned his instagram username in his reply. As I did not have instagram account, I asked my <a href="https://github.com/TheFakeS1imShady">teammate</a> to confirm whether the photographer had the image in his account. Yes, he did, and the flag was in the same <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B3oKrLQgpko">instagram post</a>! The flag was:</p>
